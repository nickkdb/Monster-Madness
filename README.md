## Description
> Monster Madness is a CLI game which allows the user to choose from a selection of hero's with different abilities and attributes, and attempt to defeat a monster in battle using the tools given! The game features three distinct types of heroes, along with monsters that have varying strength levels and likeliness to flee. The users can use special items, heal, attack, defend, or flee. The monster has all the same options, excluding the ability to use items. This project was built using the Java language

## Installation
> To install the program, create a clone of this repository on your local machine. Do so by copying the link to this repository, adding ".git" to the end of said link, and navigating to the directory you wish to clone to. From the command line, enter the command "git clone " followed by the link, and the program will install!

## Usage
> To use this program, you must convert the files within the repository to .class files so your computer can understand the code. If you do not have the java compiler installed on your machine already, navigate to oracle's website, where you can find the download files as well as instructions on how to do so. Alternatively, check to see if your IDE of choice has a built-in java compiler from its internal terminal, or the option to install an extension which adds the feature. Once you have the compiler, navigate to the cloned directory from your terminal and run the command "javac heromon.java". If this was successful, each of the four .java files should now have a corresponding .class file. From here, run the command "java heromon.java" and the game should start!
